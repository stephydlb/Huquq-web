# Application Optimization Task

## Completed Optimizations

### Code Cleanup
- [x] Removed unused component files: Navigation.tsx, Payments_new.tsx, SecurityModal_new.tsx, Dashboard_fixed.tsx
- [x] Removed unused Tailwind config files: tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, postcss.config.cjs
- [x] Cleaned up unused imports in Settings.tsx and Welcome.tsx

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Implemented lazy loading for all route components (Dashboard, Transactions, Calculator, Payments, Planning, Settings, Help, Navigation, SecurityModal, Welcome)
- [x] Added Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks
- [x] Configured Vite build for code splitting with manual chunks (vendor, mui, router, utils)
- [x] Enabled Terser minification

### Build Fixes
- [x] Fixed TypeScript errors in GoogleDriveService.ts (added userId parameters)
- [x] Fixed missing imports in components
- [x] Verified build process completes successfully

## Benefits
- Reduced bundle size through code splitting and lazy loading
- Faster initial load times with on-demand component loading
- Cleaner codebase with removed unused files
- Better caching with separate chunks for different libraries
- Improved development experience with proper TypeScript types
